# Frontend Mentor - Rock, Paper, Scissors solution

This is a solution to the [Rock, Paper, Scissors challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size 
  - mobile: 360px
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://rock-paper-scissors-one-psi.vercel.app/)

## My process

I like styling as I build out the html layout. Once the page looked like it should, I added the javascript and animations.

### Blockers

I perceived that the shadows in each choice button were gradients. Later, with the help of another developer, I found out that they were box shadows using the inset value. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
